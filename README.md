## What is Her Psykhe?

### About

Psykhe is the greek goddess of the human mind, a testament to the delicate and formidable presence of the human condition. For women, ovulation is a powerful force of nature that impacts every aspect of life. It drives us... and sometimes it doesn't allow us to be the ones sitting in the drivers seat. Right now, there are about a million cycle tracking apps out there, each with their own unique features. But none of them give women the tools to better understand how our minds impact our bodies and our bodies impact our minds. Tracking of mental and emotional state should not take a backseat to physical experiences surrounding ovulation cycles. If we can synchronize that relationship, we can harness that power and in turn better understand ourselves. 

Her Psykhe aims to equip women with the tools to improve mental wellness with cues from our bodies.
